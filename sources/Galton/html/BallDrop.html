The normal (or Gaussian) distribution is one of the most commonly observed
and is the starting point for modeling many natural processes.  It usually
is found in events that are the aggregation of many smaller, but
unobservable events.  A good example is the motion of small particles
of dust in water.  When viewed in a microscope they perpetually move back
and forth from the random impacts of water molecules.  If one were
to plot the distance traveled by dust particles over a given time interval
and repeat the measurement several times, the resulting distribution
would be normal.  The path followed by the dust particles is referred
to as Brownian motion.  In this case, the movement of the dust is the
aggregation of several random shocks from the water molecules.<P>
The exhibit below illustrates a more simple process that gives rise
to the familiar "bell curve" of the normal distribution.  In this case
balls are dropped from the top and pass through a series of pins
until they hit the bottom.  Once at the bottom, they stack up to record
the number that have hit that point.  At first there does not seem to be any
pattern but after a few minutes the stacks conform to the superimposed
curve.<P>
