<p>These animations model the 
charging of parallel-plate capacitors in different configurations as the blue electrons are 
separated from the positively charged atoms  due to the electric potential 
difference.&nbsp; <a href="JavaScript:parallel_battery()">Restart</a>. </p>

<p><a href="JavaScript:parallel_battery()">Consider two capacitors in parallel 
connected to a battery</a>.&nbsp; When you push the 
  &quot;play&quot; button, the battery is connected to the capacitors and the electrons 
  slowly begin to leave the vicinity of the positive charges.&nbsp; The charge pairs separate.&nbsp; Charges pile up until the 
electric potential 
  between the two plates of the capacitor matches the electric potential of the battery.&nbsp; Note that the number of 
  charges on the top plates of the two capacitors is essentially the same.&nbsp; 
They may 
  differ by a few charges.&nbsp; This is because the two capacitors are 
identical and therefore have the same capacitance.&nbsp; Since they are in 
parallel, they have the same electric potential difference between their plates.&nbsp; 
Therefore, the number of positive and negative charges on each of the pairs of 
plates must be the same because capacitance is defined as C = Q/&Delta;V.&nbsp; Note that, if the capacitors were not identical, they would still have the 
same electric potential difference across their plates, but their charges would 
be different.</p>

<p>Contrast this with <a href="JavaScript:series_battery()">two capacitors in 
series connected to a battery</a>.&nbsp; 
  Again, push the start button to connect the battery to the capacitors.&nbsp; 
Notice that the negative charges that end up on the left capacitor come from the 
right capacitor.&nbsp; Also note that the negative charges that end up on the 
right capacitor come from the left capacitor. &nbsp;Therefore, the charge on one 
pair of capacitor plates is the same as on the other pair of capacitor 
plates.&nbsp; In this case, for a series configuration, 
  the sum of the electric potential differences across each of the individual 
capacitors equals the electric potential difference of the 
  battery. </p>
<p>Instead of connecting to a battery, now let's assume that there is a reservoir of excess 
  positive charge on one end of the configuration and a connection to ground (a reservoir of negative 
  charges) at the other end of the configuration of capacitors.&nbsp; Consider <a href="JavaScript:parallel_charge()">
two capacitors of different capacitance in parallel</a>.&nbsp;What happens?&nbsp; Which 
capacitor 
  holds more charge?&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Since the capacitors are in parallel, the 
electric potential difference across each of the capacitors must be the same.&nbsp; 
As a consequence, since the capacitance must be different for each capacitor, the 
amount of charge on each capacitor must be different.&nbsp; The capacitor on the 
right has the larger capacitance (C = &epsilon;<sub>0</sub>A/d) and therefore has the larger 
charge.</p>
<p>Finally, consider <a href="JavaScript:series_charge()">two different 
capacitors connected in series</a>.&nbsp; As in the series case with the battery,&nbsp;both 
capacitors contain the same charge.&nbsp; Which one has the greater potential 
difference across it?&nbsp; Since&nbsp;&#916;V = Q/C, the capacitor on the left 
(with the larger capacitance) has the larger electric potential difference 
across it.</p>
