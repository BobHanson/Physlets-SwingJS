<p>The  animation shows a parallel-plate capacitor (at the top) connected 
to a battery (at the bottom).&nbsp; This 
Illustration shows you what happens when the battery 
is connected and the blue electrons are separated from the positively-charged 
atoms.&nbsp; This animation only shows what happens for ten charge pairs.&nbsp; <a href="JavaScript:nulstil()">Restart</a>.</p>

<p>As the electrons pile up on the left plate, what is the direction of the 
  electric field between the plates?&nbsp; The electric field always points from 
positive charges and toward negative charges; therefore, the electric field 
points to the left.&nbsp; Charges move until the electric potential 
  between the two plates matches the electric potential of the battery.</p>

<p>Now change the configuration to <a href="JavaScript:config2()">add a thin dielectric between the capacitor</a>.&nbsp; 
  What happens to the atoms on the dielectric material between the plates (represented by 
  the circles)?&nbsp; Due to the electric field created by the charges on the 
capacitor plates, the charges in the dielectric are polarized.&nbsp; Since positive 
and negative charges experience forces in opposite directions in the same 
electric field, the electrons move to the right and the positively charged 
atoms move to the left.&nbsp; Note that these charges are not free to completely 
separate and move like the charges in the plates and wires.&nbsp; They only 
polarize.&nbsp; Because these charges are still bound together, we call them 
bound charges.</p>

<p>What is the direction of the electric field due to the 
  separation of charge (the bound charge) in the dielectric?&nbsp; It is in the 
opposite direction from the initial electric field.&nbsp; Thus, the overall 
electric field between the plates (for the same number of charges) is smaller.&nbsp; 
Since the potential across the plates matches the potential of the battery, is 
this battery bigger or smaller than the first one?&nbsp; If the charge on the capacitor is the same in both animations, and the 
capacitance is increased with the inclusion of the dielectric (C = k &#949;<sub>0</sub>A/d), 
then &#916;V = Q/C shows us that the electric potential difference is reduced.&nbsp; 
In addition, since the electric field is reduced, the electric potential is 
similarly reduced (for a constant electric field &#916;V = -Ed).</p>
<p>If the battery was the same in the two animations (&#916;V would be the same 
between the plates), the set of plates 
  with a dielectric between them would be able to hold more charge.&nbsp;  
Using &#916;V = -Ed, the electric field between the plates would have to be the same 
in the two animations.&nbsp; Because the bound charge of the dielectric reduces 
the electric field between the plates, there would have to be more charge on the 
plates with the dielectric present than without.&nbsp; This  explains why the capacitance 
of the capacitor is greater with a dielectric.</p>
